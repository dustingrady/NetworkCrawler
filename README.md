NetCrawler is a network discovery tool (currently under development) that attempts to reveal information about connected devices within a network.

This tool may be suited for:
  - Those wishing to perform a basic visibility/pen test of their network
  - Systems Administrators
  - Curious folk

#### Discovery Methods
  - Multi-threaded (brute force) pinging
  - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
 
#### Future Enhancements
  - Generate pen test reports of a given network
  - Provide more detailed information of discovered devices (OS/ port activity/ etc)
  - Give the ability for user to enter a specific IP address/range
  - Linux support

#### Tech
* [Tkinter] - Tkinter Graphical libraries to build GUI elements
* [Python 3] - Python for everything else

#### OS Support
* Windows
